## Context & Motivation

AI Trading Insights was created to simplify how traders understand market data, token behavior, and historical patterns across the Cardano ecosystem.

Instead of raw charts and disconnected metrics, the platform generates structured summaries powered by large language models — helping users interpret complex data through a clear and human-readable interface.

This initiative was proposed and funded through Project Catalyst:

That strong community backing highlights the demand for a smarter, more accessible way to engage with Cardano native assets.
