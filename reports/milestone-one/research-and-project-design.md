# Submission for Milestone 1: AI Trading Insights

I am pleased to submit Milestone 1 for AI Trading Insights. This milestone marks the successful completion of the research, planning, and design phase, laying a strong foundation for the development of an AI-powered trading insights platform.

Throughout this phase, I have dedicated considerable effort to understanding the intricacies of historical trading data analysis, token movement patterns, and market trend identification. This research has informed the technical design and strategic direction of the project, ensuring that future development is both structured and scalable.

A comprehensive technical design document has been developed, detailing the overall system architecture. Key aspects of the design include:

- **Data Ingestion:** A scheduled daily batch process that seamlessly gathers and processes market data with support to extend to multiple providers.
- **Cloud-Based LLM Analysis:** Leveraging state-of-the-art cloud-hosted LLMs to generate actionable insights from the ingested data.
- **Scalable and Optimised Architecture:** Implementation of both client-side and server-side caching to enhance performance, reduce redundant API calls, and ensure a responsive user experience.
- **Database Design:** An optimised PostgreSQL database structure that supports complex analytical queries while ensuring data integrity, with futureproofing in mind for easy extension.

The architectural blueprint not only highlights the data flow from the website user to the backend processes but also demonstrates my commitment to performance optimisation and extensibility. This foundational work has been designed to support seamless integration of additional data providers and the future evolution of the platform.

## Documentation Repository

Instead of storing the research, planning, and design documentation in a Google Document, I felt it would be better suited to be stored in a public GitHub repository. While the code itself will remain closed source, as instructed in the proposal, my intention is that by making the research, planning, and design documentation accessible, it will provide value to others in the space who are working on similar challenges. This approach promotes transparency, encourages collaboration, and ensures that the foundational work done here can have a wider impact beyond this specific project. This will also allow additional changes to be incorporated as the project progresses, ensuring that the documentation remains up-to-date.

Given the fast-moving landscape of AI advancements, I anticipate that some elements of this research and detailed project plan may evolve over time. However, the goal has always been to exceed the originally promised functionality and ensure that this is a futureproof solution that excels beyond initial expectations.
